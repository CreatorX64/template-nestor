(other notes below)

Each section title in **index.html** file is tagged with the "@" character. To navigate easier in this file, use the search functionality of your text editor and search for "_@section_name_". For instance to go to the _CTA_ section you can do `Ctrl+F` and search for "@cta", to go to the _How It Works_ section you can search for "@how it works", and so on. After the saerch, you'll be brought to the beginning of the section. Make sure you're searching in case insensitive mode to make the search easier.

Here are all the section names you can use with above information:

- Navigation
- Hero
- Features
- How it works
- Data points
- Testimonials
- Pricing
- Newsletter
- CTA
- Footer

In the _index.html_ file, important notes are tagged with "@NOTE" comment. I recommend reading these comments before you make updates to the file as they can save you a lot of time. Again, to see the imporant notes, you can search for "@NOTE" in your text editor.
